# iOS Integration Guide

## **Introduction**

The goal of the iOS BlockID Mobile SDK documentation is to give any developer with iOS experience the knowledge and understanding required to create . . .

In addition to detailing how to use the iOS version of the BlockID Mobile SDK, this documentation describes . . . 


## **Prerequisites**

Several general and specific iOS prerequisites are required to develop an application with the iOS version of the BlockID Mobile SDK.

### General

- An understanding of how to develop applications for iOS
- At least one compatible iOS mobile device

### iOS

- Xcode 10.2+ or higher
  - Deployment target of iOS 11.0 or higher
  - Swift 5.0 or higher
- Cocoapods 1.9.3 or higher
- iOS Developer account
- Device support
  - iPhone 5s or later
  - iPod Touch (6th generation) or later

## **Integrate SDK into Application**

The examples below import the BlockID SDK into a new iOS project. The same steps can be used for integration into an existing application.

### Xcode Project Integration

:::note Screenshots in this section are generated using Xcode 13.0.
:::

#### Create a New Application

- Step 1 
- Step 2
- Step 3

#### Install SDK in the Project

As of writing this document, the BlockID iOS SDK can only be installed using manual process as described below:

#### Download the BlockID SDK

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3 

#### Adding Required iOS Libraries

- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3


## **Application Deployment**

### Xcode Configuration

iOS applications require proper Xcode configuration. A below workaround for an App Store submission bug when archiving universal binaries is required

- Create a new **Run Script Phase** in the application target's **Build Phases**

- Paste the following in the script text field

```shell 
APP_PATH="${TARGET_BUILD_DIR}/${WRAPPER_NAME}"

# This script loops through the frameworks embedded in the application and
# removes unused architectures.
find "$APP_PATH" -name '*.framework' -type d | while read -r FRAMEWORK
do
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME=$(defaults read "$FRAMEWORK/Info.plist" CFBundleExecutable)
    FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH="$FRAMEWORK/$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"

    if [ ! -f "${FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH}" ]; then
        continue
    fi

    if xcrun lipo -info "${FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH}" | grep --silent "Non-fat"; then
        echo "Framework non-fat, skipping: $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
        continue
    fi

    echo "Thinning framework $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"

    EXTRACTED_ARCHS=()

    for ARCH in $ARCHS
    do
        echo "Extracting $ARCH from $FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_NAME"
        xcrun lipo -extract "$ARCH" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH" -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH"
        EXTRACTED_ARCHS+=("$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-$ARCH")
    done

    echo "Merging extracted architectures: ${ARCHS}"
    xcrun lipo -o "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" -create "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"
    rm "${EXTRACTED_ARCHS[@]}"

    echo "Replacing original executable with thinned version"
    rm "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
    mv "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH-merged" "$FRAMEWORK_EXECUTABLE_PATH"
done
```
